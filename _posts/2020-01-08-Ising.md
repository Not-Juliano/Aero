The Ising model is an example of a Canonical ensemble in thermodynamics. In most cases; It’s used to theoretically describe ferromagnetism, and used for phase transitions.

The model was invented by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920 and is named after Ernst Ising who solved it in 1D [source]: http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/329/lectures/node110.html
