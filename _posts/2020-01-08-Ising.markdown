The Ising model is an example of a Canonical ensemble in thermodynamics. In most cases; It’s used to theoretically describe ferromagnetism, and used for phase transitions.
The model was invented by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920 and is named after Ernst Ising who solved it in 1D [source] [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/329/lectures/node110.html]
The model has gained the love of some physicist because it applies to many areas and it allows computations of thermodynamic quantities in a system. (Energy, Specific heat, Entropy ect.)


So how does the model work? In essence you can break this ensemble down into three main parts. A hamiltonian, Spin dynamics, and phase transitions.
The Equation is shown below:

J is the coupling strength. (How strongly these things interact). 

σ represents each spin. 

h is the external magnetic field


J also tells you how these things prefer to align.

When J>0, the spin wants to be like neighbors- making this interaction ferromagnetic 

When J<0, the spin wants to be unlike it's neighbors- making this interaction Antiferromagnetic
